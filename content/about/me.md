## Me

I have passion for network engineering, telecommunication, programming automation nd infrastructure in general. I am currently working at [OVH](http://ovh.com) as Tech lead in the Network Automation team.

You will find in this blog many articles I've been writing (I like to write article and documentation but it's sometime hard to find subjects or time to do so)

Also feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/mpoussin), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kedare) or [Github](https://github.com/kedare) profiles
