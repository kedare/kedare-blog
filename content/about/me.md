I'm a French guy living in Barcelona.

I have passion for network engineering, telecommunication, programming and infrastructure in general. I am working as Head of Infrastructure in the very sucessful [Lodgify](https://www.lodgify.com) startup

You will find in this blog many articles I've been writing (I like to write article and documentation but it's sometime hard to find subjects or time)

Also feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/mpoussin), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kedare) or [Github](https://github.com/kedare) profiles
