## Me

I have passion for network engineering, telecommunication, programming automation nd infrastructure in general. I am currently working at [OVH](http://ovh.com) as Tech lead in the Network Automation team.

You will find in this blog many articles I've been writing (I like to write article and documentation but it's sometime hard to find subjects or time to do so)

Also feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/mpoussin), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kedare) or [Github](https://github.com/kedare) profiles

      My most important projects were the migration of the infrastructuer from legacy on premise to Google Cloud (and an on-side datacenter for some non production critical parts).

      My largest development project was the development of the website manager that is an microservice allowing dynamic update and replication of some part of the reverse proxies, allowing us to manage ten thousands of certificate and redirection rules without interuption.
